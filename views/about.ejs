    <h2>What RecipeCraft Is Used For</h2>
    <p>
     The site will serve as your personal recipe book. You do not need to go through screenshots, notes, and other older messages to find the information about every meal; instead, 
     it is possible to store all the meals in a clean format with the most important information that you might have to use when you need to cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recipes may have the name of the dish, ingredients, step-by-step instructions, preparation and cooking time, equipment required, personal comment, and an optional picture or thumbnail. 
      This allows one to repeat a meal in the same manner that he/she liked it or even better the next time he/she make it.
